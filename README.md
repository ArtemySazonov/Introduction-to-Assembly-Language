**Abstract.** An assembly language is a low-level programming language used for computers and other embedded devices that are focused on a specific microprocessor architecture. This course is designed for students who need to learn about this "processor language" and master the assembly programming language. This course is practical and includes a large number of tasks that are automatically checked. The knowledge and skills acquired through this course are sufficient to start programming in assembly, and from there, you can progress to a higher level of programming. The course focuses on assembly language for Intel and Arm architectures.
